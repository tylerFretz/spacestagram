# Spacestagram

A react app which displays the most recent photos from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day using their [API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).

Allows users to vote on their favourite photos. I decided to use FingerPrintJS to identify users as forcing users to create an account in order
to be able to track their vote seemed like overkill for a simple app such as this.
